KEY:
Office-Suite - Encryption Type _ Password Used _ . Extension
Example: 2007-Office97-2000_myhovercraftisfullofeels_.doc
Office 2007 created this file
Encrypted using the Office 97-2000 (RC4?) setting
Using the password "myhovercraftisfullofeels"

**NOTES
LibreOffice 3.5.1 cannot open the Excel documents saved using
the Office97-2000 password encrypted types when created/saved 
by the MS Office 2007 suite. The Word files and LibreOffice 
work fine as long as the password is truncated to 15 characters 
(myhovercraftisf).


I am filing a bug report.
