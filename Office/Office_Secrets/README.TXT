Files in these directories follow this naming
convention:
Office-Suite - Encryption Type _ Password Used _ . Extention

The encryption type is often just the name given
when saving if nothing about that encryption
type is know by the author. The password used
is surrounded by underscores, they are not
part of the password.

Each of the files created are from fresh install
of each one of the Office suites. No patches, service
packs or compatibility packs applied. While I
do not code myself, I have located a number of
resources about the encryption being used below:
